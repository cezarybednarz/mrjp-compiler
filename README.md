# Latte language compiler
### Author: Cezary Bednarz 

## About
Compiler of Java-like Latte language. Syntax in BNF form is defined in `src/Latte.cf`. Examples can be found in `test` folder.

## Tools
Compiler is written in Haskell.
Parser is generated by BNFC version 2.9.1 using grammar defined in file `src/Latte.cf` and was generated using following command:
`bnfc --haskell --functor -d -o src Latte.cf`
All used modules are defined in `package.yaml` in the main directory.

## Running 
 - `make`: builds compiler
 - `./insc <path to Latte file>`: compiles input file
 - TODO

## File structure
 - `src/`
   - `Main.hs`: gets input file and compiles it
   - `Frontend/`: module which executes semantic analysis
   - `Latte/`: folder with parser files generated by BNFC
   - TODO
